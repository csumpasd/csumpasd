### Hi there! 

---

I'm Marton,

currently studying CS at BME, but I'm also interested in fields such as Bioengineering and Nuclear Physics, and you can find me in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community as well.
Concerned by AGI alignment and the general disregard of safety in the field by big corporations, I hope to have an impact in this area.
Below I've listed my current software-related projects, knowledge, and at the bottom you can find some of my contact options. 
Have a nice day!
