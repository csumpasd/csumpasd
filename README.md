### Projects

Some things I'm working on:
* a BME Map app
* sleeping better
* learning fabric-based modding
* figuring out a better way to list my projects, maybe a trello type of thing? (hit me up if you know a good open source project tracker)
* writing a well organised list of all the useful programs, things and tweaks I used to turn my online life and devices private

Some of my previous works:
* setting up an apache2 & nginx server and hosting my website
* javascript-based collision simulation (planning a rewrite which I'll upload here)
* by far the most difficult one of them all, installing Arch Linux (jk, i can do it from memory)
* ... and many others
