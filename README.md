### Projects

Some things I'm working on:
* A BME Map app
* Sleeping better
* Learning fabric-based modding
* Figuring out a better way to list my projects, maybe a trello type of thing? (hit me up if you know a good open source project tracker)
* Writing a well organised list of all the useful programs, things and tweaks I used to turn my online life and devices private

Some of my previous works:
* Setting up an apache2 & nginx server and hosting my website
* Javascript-based collision simulation (planning a rewrite which I'll upload here)
* By far the most difficult one of them all, installing Arch Linux (jk, i can do it from memory)
* ... and many others
