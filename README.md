### hi there!

I'm marton,

part time student of computer science at [BME](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en), and part time science and data enthusiast. <br>
I seek out and strive to understand complex systems, including AI, neurobiology, quantum physics, and bionics. <br>
When not studying for university, I'm most likely either learning about the above topics, working on my own projects, or lifting weights. 

This github page is where you can find some of the code I write. I think it effectively showcases the progression of my skills over time.
