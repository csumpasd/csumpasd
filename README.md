### Hey there

---

I am an 18 years old **student** learning to be a **software developer**.

I'm interested in hardware, software, physics, drawing, and gaming, among lots of others. I'm keen on **collaborating** with others, and I like to take part in developing solutions for real world problems. I also believe that **privacy** and **freedom** are fundamental **human rights**, thus I plan to involve myself in software projects centered around these.

### Projects

Some things I'm working on:
* a boot animation for my phone
* a game with text-based graphics
* learning fabric-based modding
* ridding my life of large corporations (it's ironic that I use github, isn't it)
* figuring out a better way to list my projects, maybe a trello type of thing? (hit me up if you know a good open source project tracker)
* writing a well organised list of all the useful programs, things and tweaks I used to turn my online life and devices private

Some of my previous works:
* setting up an apache2 server and hosting my website
* javascript-based collision simulation (planning a rewrite which I'll upload here)
* by far the most difficult one of them all, installing Arch Linux (just kidding, it wasn't that hard)
* ... and many others
