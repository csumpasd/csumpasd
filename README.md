### Hi there! 

---

I'm Marton,

currently studying CS at BME, but I'm also interested in fields such as Bioengineering and Nuclear Physics, and you can find me in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community as well.
Concerned by issues such as Global Warming, Malicious AI, and Biosecurity, I'm working towards maximising my impact in one of these cause areas.
Below I've listed my current software-related projects, and past knowledge, and at the bottom you can find some of my contact options. 
Have a nice day!
